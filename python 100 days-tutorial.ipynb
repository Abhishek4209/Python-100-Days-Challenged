    "## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python: In programming languages, mainly there are two approaches that are used to write program or code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1). Procedural Programming\n",
    "## 2). Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "### The procedure we are following till now is the “Procedural Programming” approach. So, in this session, we will learn about Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The basic idea of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python is to use classes and objects to represent real-world concepts and entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties and methods that an object of that class will have. Properties are the data or state of an object, and methods are the actions or behaviors that an object can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An object is an instance of a class, and it contains its own data and methods. For example, you could create a class called \"Person\" that has properties such as name and age, and methods such as speak() and walk(). Each instance of the Person class would be a unique object with its own name and age, but they would all have the same methods to speak and walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One of the key features of OOP in Python is encapsulation, which means that the internal state of an object is hidden and can only be accessed or modified through the object's methods. This helps to protect the object's data and prevent it from being modified in unexpected ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another key feature of OOP in Python is inheritance, which allows new classes to be created that inherit the properties and methods of an existing class. This allows for code reuse and makes it easy to create new classes that have similar functionality to existing classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism is also supported in Python, which means that objects of different classes can be treated as if they were objects of a common class. This allows for greater flexibility in code and makes it easier to write code that can work with multiple types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In summary, OOP in Python allows developers to model real-world concepts and entities using classes and objects, encapsulate data, reuse code through inheritance, and write more flexible code through polymorphism.\n",

    "### Python decorators are a powerful and versatile tool that allow you to modify the behavior of functions and methods. They are a way to extend the functionality of a function or method without modifying its source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that modifies the behavior of the original function. The new function is often referred to as a \"decorated\" function. The basic syntax for using a decorator is the following:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Decorators are often used to add functionality to functions and methods, such as logging, memoization, and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical use case:-\n",
    "##### One common use of decorators is to add logging to a function. For example, you could use a decorator to log the arguments and return value of a function each time it is called:\n",

    "###         return self._value\n",
    "### In this example, the MyClass class has a single property, _value, which is initialized in the init method. The value method is defined as a getter using the @property decorator, and is used to return the value of the _value property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To use the getter, we can create an instance of the MyClass class, and then access the value property as if it were an attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "### >>> obj = MyClass(10)\n",
    "### >>> obj.value\n",
    "### 10\n",
    "## **Setters:-**\n",
    "### It is important to note that the getters do not take any parameters and we cannot set the value through getter method.For that we need setter method which can be added by decorating method with @property_name.setter\n",

    "### Here is an example of a class with both getter and setter:\n",
    "\n",
    "### class MyClass:\n",
    "###     def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "###         self._value = value\n",

    "###     def value(self):\n",
    "###         return self._value\n",

    "###     @value.setter\n",
    "###     def value(self, new_value):\n",
    "###         self._value = new_value\n",
    "### We can use setter method like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### >>> obj = MyClass(10)\n",
    "### >>> obj.value = 20\n",
    "### >>> obj.value\n",
    "### 20\n",

    "## **Python Class Methods:-**\n",
    "### Python Class Methods: An Introduction\n",
    "###### In Python, classes are a way to define custom data types that can store data and define functions that can manipulate that data. One type of function that can be defined within a class is called a \"method.\" In this blog post, we will explore what Python class methods are, why they are useful, and how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Python Class Methods?\n",
    "###### A class method is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. Class methods are defined using the \"@classmethod\" decorator, followed by a function definition. The first argument of the function is always \"cls,\" which represents the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Python Class Methods?\n",
    "###### Class methods are useful in several situations. For example, you might want to create a factory method that creates instances of your class in a specific way. You could define a class method that creates the instance and returns it to the caller. Another common use case is to provide alternative constructors for your class. This can be useful if you want to create instances of your class in multiple ways, but still have a consistent interface for doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use Python Class Methods\n",
    "###### To define a class method, you simply use the \"@classmethod\" decorator before the method definition. The first argument of the method should always be \"cls,\" which represents the class itself. Here is an example of how to define a class method:\n",
    "\n",
    "## **class ExampleClass:-**\n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def factory_method(cls, argument1, argument2):\n",
    "        return cls(argument1, argument2)\n",
    "In this example, the \"factory_method\" is a class method that takes two arguments, \"argument1\" and \"argument2.\" It creates a new instance of the class \"ExampleClass\" using the \"cls\" keyword, and returns the new instance to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that class methods cannot modify the class in any way. If you need to modify the class, you should use a class level variable instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion:-**\n",
    "###### Python class methods are a powerful tool for defining functions that operate on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. They are useful for creating factory methods, alternative constructors, and other types of methods that operate at the class level. With the knowledge of how to define and use class methods, you can start writing more complex and organized code in Python."

    "## **Super keyword in Python:-**\n",
    "#### The super() keyword in Python is used to refer to the parent class. It is especially useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes and you want to call a method from one of the parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When a class inherits from a parent class, it can override or extend the methods defined in the parent class. However, sometimes you might want to use the parent class method in the child class. This is where the super() keyword comes in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's an example of how to use the super() keyword in a simple inheritance scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "### class ParentClass:\n",
    "#####    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "#####        print(\"This is the parent method.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "###    def child_method(self):\n",
    "###        print(\"This is the child method.\")\n",
    "###        super().parent_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### child_object = ChildClass()\n",
    "#### child_object.child_method()\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "#### This is the child method.\n",
    "#### This is the parent method.\n",
    "#### In this example, we have a ParentClass with a parent_method and a ChildClass that inherits from ParentClass and overrides the child_method. When the child_method is called, it first prints \"This is the child method.\" and then calls the parent_method using the super() keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The super() keyword is also useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes. In this case, you can specify the parent class from which you want to call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### class ParentClass1:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the parent method of ParentClass1.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### class ParentClass2:\n",
    "    def parent_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the parent method of ParentClass2.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "#### class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2):\n",
    "    def child_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is the child method.\")\n",
    "        super().parent_method()\n",
    "\n",
    "#### child_object = ChildClass()\n",
    "#### child_object.child_method()\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "#### This is the child method.\n",
    "#### This is the parent method of ParentClass1.\n",
    "#### In this example, the ChildClass inherits from both ParentClass1 and ParentClass2. The child_method calls the parent_method of the first parent class using the super() keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In conclusion, the super() keyword is a useful tool in Python when you want to call a parent class method in a child class. It can be used in inheritance scenarios with a single parent class or multiple parent classes."

    "### **Operator Overloading in Python:-** \n",
    "An Introduction\n",
    "Operator Overloading is a feature in Python that allows developers to redefine the behavior of mathematical and comparison operators for custom data types. This means that you can use the standard mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, etc.) and comparison operators (>, <, ==, etc.) in your own classes, just as you would for built-in data types like int, float, and str.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do we need operator overloading?\n",
    "## Operator overloading allows you to create more readable and intuitive code. For instance, consider a custom class that represents a point in 2D space. You could define a method called 'add' to add two points together, but using the + operator makes the code more concise and readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "p1 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "p2 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "p3 = p1 + p2\n",
    "print(p3.x, p3.y) # prints 4, 6\n",
    "### How to overload an operator in Python?\n",
    "### You can overload an operator in Python by defining special methods in your class. These methods are identified by their names, which start and end with double underscores (__). Here are some of the most commonly overloaded operators and their corresponding special methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ : __add__\n",
    "- : __sub__\n",
    "* : __mul__\n",
    "/ : __truediv__\n",
    "< : __lt__\n",
    "> : __gt__\n",
    "== : __eq__\n",
    "For example, if you want to overload the + operator to add two instances of a custom class, you would define the add method:\n",
    "\n",
    "## class Point:\n",
    "###    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "###        self.x = x\n",
    "###        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "###    def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "###        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "### It's important to note that operator overloading is not limited to the built-in operators, you can overload any user-defined operator as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion:-**\n",
    "###  Operator overloading is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to create more readable and intuitive code. By redefining the behavior of mathematical and comparison operators for custom data types, you can write code that is both concise and expressive. However, it's important to use operator overloading wisely, as overloading the wrong operator or using it inappropriately can lead to confusing or unexpected behavior."
